game will mean a situation characterized by three components: (1) a set of people involved called players, (2), a set of allowable moves that each player can make, known as strategies, and (3) a description of how each player feels about the possible outcomes mathematically described by a payoff or utility function.

In game theory, when a player's action (like her yelling) leads to a worse outcome than another action (her hailing the other cab going by), for every possible way other players decide to act (in each situation, the chance I would give her the cab), the action is said to be dominated.

There is an obvious lesson from game theory: never choose a dominated action. If you learn one thing from this book, let this be the lesson: please, never, never play dominated strategies.

The naive strategy would be to pick the face you found to be the most attractive. A better strategy would be to pick the face that you thought other people would find attractive.

What actually happens depends on what people think everyone else will be guessing. Both equilibria—all 0 and all 1—are achievable.

The example illustrates a flaw of IEDS. It can get you reasonable answers if you think players are reasoning out further and further in nested logic. We often do not have an infinite capacity to reason logically, only a bounded ability to reason rationality.

The practical answer to what you should write depends on the book answer plus your subjective beliefs about what other people do. It is the combination of book smarts plus social smarts that matters.

A dominated strategy is one that you should never play. The flip side is a dominant strategy, a strategy that always makes sense and should be played.

The point of a Nash equilibrium is that it is the result of competition when players take into account what others will do and how they can influence the game. Some Nash equilibria will seem fair while others will not.
